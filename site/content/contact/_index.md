I'm Brett Anderson, based in Orange County, California. I'm currently working as the Creative Director at [KWALL](https://kwallcompany.com/), leading design for the client and internal work. I have the great fortune of teaching the Internet Design 1 class at [Laguna College of Art + Design (LCAD)](https://lcad.edu/). I graduated from LCAD and was known as the web guy. I have a passion for creating unique designs for my clients, I want to present them in a way that's not something you can find off the shelf.
